# Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques based on meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.

## 💡 Features

- Predicts whether it will rain or not (binary classification)
- Supports multiple machine learning models for comparison
- Visualizes feature importance and model performance
- Uses historical weather data for training and evaluation

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- **ML Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle or IMD or hypothetical]
- Features include:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - Pressure
  - Rainfall Today (optional)
- Target: `RainTomorrow` (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rainfall-prediction.git
